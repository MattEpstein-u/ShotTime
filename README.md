Simulation and analysis of basketball drill

Often when I practice basketball, I will set out to make two free throws in a row before leaving the gym. It gives me a sense of accomplishment at the end of the workout, regardless of the quality the rest of the workout.

One day, I set out to shoot three-pointers until I made 4 three-pointers in a row, and then immediately 4 free throws in a row. I started the exercise and I had no idea what I signed up for but I was determined to follow through. It took me around 25 minutes to complete the drill. When I got back to my computer, I designed a python code to simulate the expiriment.
